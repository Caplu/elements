##Building A New Sidechain with Elements

This is a basic step-by-step guide to building your own sidechain and setting up a fedpeg. This configuration works to run a sidechain with a 1-of-1 functionary/blocksigner. (Not tested on multiple nodes with more than 1 signer)

####Elements
Please look over the [Elements Project](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements) if you haven't already. Also read [Alpha README](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/alpha-README.md) for building dependencies and to follow along. The instructions for building the dependencies are pretty cut and clear, however, the building of a new fedpeg isn't as detailed. Keep the Elements Project's Alpha-README open in a separate tab for reference. 

####Prerequisites
1. Linux. Building with Windows is possible - publish a guide if you know how as there isn't one publicly available! :)
2. All dependencies for Elements-Alpha. [Build Notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)

####Build
Try to follow this order to avoid unneccessary recompilations. This is an extension of the instructions to "Run a fedpeg operator" in the Element's alpha README.

Edit your `.bashrc`. We'll come back to this file later:
```
RPC_USER=your_username_here
RPC_PASSWORD=your_super_random_long_password_here
export RPC_USER
export RPC_PASS
```

Bitcoin testnet (mainchain):
```
git clone https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements
cd elements
git checkout mainchain
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
mv src/bitcoin{d,-cli,-tx} ../
```

Run testnet. If you get an error asking to rebuild the blockchain, replace `-txindex` with `-reindex`. If you have to rebuild it, continue these instructions while it syncs:
```
./bitcoind -rpcuser=$RPC_USER -rpcpassword=$RPC_PASS -testnet -txindex -daemon
```

Checkout `alpha`. We won't compile just yet. Make sure it is up-to-date with the Elements repo alpha branch:
```
git checkout alpha
```

With bitcoin testnet, generate an address and obtain the private/public key.
```
bitcoin-cli -testnet getnewaddress //returns some address
bitcoin-cli -testnet validateaddress [address] //returns JSON object. Copy the public key.
bitcoin-cli -testnet dumpprivkey [address] //returns private key. Save this - we'll need it later for .bashrc file
```
You should be on your sidechain branch (alpha). This is the part where we uniquely create your sidechain with the public keys of each functionary/blocksigner. Open `src/chainparams.cpp` and edit the public keys, ports, and seeds. [Line 132](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/chainparams.cpp#L132) has the public keys for each functionary/blocksigner: 
```
scriptDestination = CScript() << OP_5 << ParseHex("027d5d62861df77fc9a37dbe901a579d686d1423be5f56d6fc50bb9de3480871d1") << ParseHex("03b41ea6ba73b94c901fdd43e782aaf70016cc124b72a086e77f6e9f4f942ca9bb") << ParseHex("02be643c3350bade7c96f6f28d1750af2ef507bc1f08dd38f82749214ab90d9037") << ParseHex("021df31471281d4478df85bfce08a10aab82601dca949a79950f8ddf7002bd915a") << ParseHex("0320ea4fcf77b63e89094e681a5bd50355900bf961c10c9c82876cb3238979c0ed") << ParseHex("021c4c92c8380659eb567b497b936b274424662909e1ffebc603672ed8433f4aa1") << ParseHex("027841250cfadc06c603da8bc58f6cd91e62f369826c8718eb6bd114601dd0c5ac") << OP_7 << OP_CHECKMULTISIG;
```
For simplicity, let's replace with current 5-of-7 with a 1-of-1. Change to: 
```
scriptDestination = CScript() << OP_1 << ParseHex("[paste public key we just generated]") << OP_1 << OP_CHECKMULTISIG;
```
[Line 139](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/chainparams.cpp#L139) has the DNS seeds. You'll need to create one of your own in order to communicate on your port. Replace the current 5 seeds with your own. Also delete the testnet seed on [L198](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/chainparams.cpp#L198). 

Still in `src/chainparams.cpp`, change the testnet port number on [L182](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/chainparams.cpp#L182) - this is the unique channel of communication for your sidechain so don't just increase/decrease it by one. This is one of two ports we'll change. Call this one the protocol port. Keep a side note of this protocol port - we'll need it later.

You need to duplicate what you did on L132 of `src/chainparams.cpp` on [L1451](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1451) of `src/script/interpreter.cpp`. Also in `src/script/interpreter.cpp`, change [L1469](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1469) using [Instagibbs' fix](https://github.com/instagibbs/elements/commit/d390521215f1b47f8d46e8af728c5d353e1db4bf).

Open `src/chainparamsbase.cpp`, change the port on [L43](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/src/chainparamsbase.cpp#L43). This is the RPC port - keep it different from the protocol port (i.e. alpha's ports are 4250 and 4251). On L44 of the same file, you can change the name of the data directory for your sidechain (where your blocks, .dat files, etc. will be stored). 

At this point, you can compile your sidechain in the same way we compiled the mainchain earlier. There are a few help/console string messages you can change in `main.cpp, init.cpp, bitcoind.cpp`, but it's not necessary for basic functional purposes. 

```
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
```

If there's a error in your compilation, go back to the file the compilation failed on and fix the error. Make sure to run `make clean` before compilating again. You'll only need to recompile your sidechain branch, not the bitcoin testnet `mainchain` branch.

Upon successful compilation:
```
mv src/alpha{d,-cli,-tx} ../
./alphad -rpcuser=$RPC_USER -rpcpassword=$RPC_PASS -testnet -rpcconnect=127.0.0.1 -rpcconnectport=18332 -tracksidechain=all -txindex -blindtrust=false -daemon
```

Once your sidechain server is running, we can edit the Python files with your unique details. Before we add your unique info, let's modify some settings for ease of use. Open `contrib/sidechain-manipulation.py`. Import `constants.py` by adding this to the top of the `sidechain-manipulation.py` file: 

```
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "fedpeg/"))
from constants import FedpegConstants
```

Change the ["Various Settings"](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/contrib/sidechain-manipulation.py#L52) to this:

```
# VARIOUS SETTINGS...
settings = FedpegConstants

sidechain_url = settings.sidechain_url
bitcoin_url = settings.bitcoin_url
secondScriptPubKeyHash = settings.secondScriptPubKeyHash
redeem_script = settings.redeem_script
secondScriptPubKey = settings.secondScriptPubKey
```

Open `contrib/fedpeg/constants.py` and configure your "Various Settings". Also change the [nodes](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/contrib/fedpeg/constants.py#L26) and `my node`:
```
# VARIOUS SETTINGS...
user = os.environ["RPC_USER"]
password = os.environ["RPC_PASS"]
sidechain_url = "http://" + user + ":" + password + "@127.0.0.1:PORTNUMBER" //RPC PORT
bitcoin_url = "http://" + user + ":" + password + "@127.0.0.1:18332"

redeem_script = "51210324a5c8922e33c0e66723450715864e1f641b8a37bea9bd3cdb6d6de56c81253e51ae"
redeem_script_address = "2NBV7zZ6V371pkgZqxkAQLh3sDQvA1xtMk8"
secondScriptPubKeyHash = "9eac001049d5c38ece8996485418421f4a01e2d7"
secondScriptPubKey = "OP_DROP 144 OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL"
blocksigning_private_key = os.environ["BLOCKSIGNING_PRIV_KEY"] 
functionary_private_key = os.environ["FUNCTIONARY_PRIV_KEY"]

....

nodes =["IP address of each functionary/blocksigner"]
my_node = "Your IP"
```

We need to create a unique redeem script and redeem script address for your sidechain. To do this, take the public key[s] in `chainparmas.cpp` and use the `createmultisig` RPC, which will return an address and a redeem script. Adjust the `constants.py` file with your returned values:
```
alpha-cli -testnet createmultisig sigs_required "[\"public key\", ...]" 
```

Open the `.bashrc` file we edited earlier and add this: 
```
BLOCKSIGNING_PRIV_KEY=[private key generated earlier - associated to the public key in chainparmas.cpp]
FUNCTIONARY_PRIV_KEY=[some private key]
export BLOCKSIGNING_PRIV_KEY
export FUNCTIONARY_PRIV_KEY
```

Also be sure to import both private keys into your sidechain wallet using the RPC command: 
```
alpha-cli -testnet importprivkey [private key]
```

The default sidechain blocktimes are set at 60 seconds. You can adjust the time on [L58](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/alpha/contrib/fedpeg/blocksign.py#L58) of `contrib/fedpeg/blocksign.py`. Be sure to change the port numbers in `blocksign.py` and `rotating_consensus.py`.
